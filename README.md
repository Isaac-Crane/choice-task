*To do:*
Make sure exits and enters are stored
Potentially change relative frequency of probes. They can occur basically right after each other at this point
Potentially introduce static if there is an issue with the last trial
Potentially change questions if we can come up with better ones
Update instructions
Make mouse dissapear during trials
